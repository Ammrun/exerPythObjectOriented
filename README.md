## Fork & Clone this repository

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice
* This can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.

## Create a Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file

* In Jupyter Notebook or VSCode navigate to your repository folder.
  * Create a new Jupyter Notebook called OOPTutorial.ipynb

* 2022 update:
  * I have created separate Jupyter Notebooks for each video. They're included in the repository.
  * Please use those to complete the assignment.
* Execute code examples in separate cells.
  * Students have found it easiest to do all the tutorials on a single Jupyter notebook so the code from previous videos is easy to see.
  * Add a comment in your code when you start code from a new video. (i.e. #video 1, #video 2, etc.)  
* When you're done make sure you save your file.
* 2024 update:
  * You should be able to open the notebooks in Google Collaboratory.
  * Instructions for working with notebooks in Google Colab can be found at https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerPyth_PackageManagerPip .
